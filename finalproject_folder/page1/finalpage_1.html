    <p>Hello! My name is Colin.Y and this is my first attempt at a webpage based game, I've always been interested in making games and programing. But didn't have many opertunities back in middle or highschool, but now that I've finally reached college I can now persue my dreams of being a web developer / game developer! Hopefully you enjoy my game.</p>

    <h2 id="colorChanger">Info about the game</h2><br>
    <p>This game is actually about a tabletop game system I'm currently working on and testing with a small handful of players. The game itself is called Rotten City, and has its own system it runs off of that uses only D6s, D8s, D10s, D12s, and D100s. You are either a recently graduated student or a professor from a nearby college either starting in suburbia, a loft in the city, or in an apartment complex inbetween the two (distance wise). The distance from the center of this massive tri-state area/city does affect difficulty because of the amount of infected, which ones are mutated due to distance from center, and stores/garages have a higher chance of being looted already. All of these factors have to deal with the distance from the center of this large area, from the easiest being in the suburbia and hardest being in the loft which gives the players the ability to choose their difficulty. In this webgame it's just a simplified version of my tabletop system where you are fighting the roaming boss Bill! He was the first scientist to really get close to the meteorite that started the infection three weeks ago. And because of this he is the most mutated of any infected, he is one tough cookie so it's going to take all of your skills and smarts to take him down without being clobbered. Using Chutzpah to heal yourself by psyching up, or your smarts to shoot him in a particularly weak spot on his person, or just straight up hitting him with your brawn! Also if you roll a 6 you may get to cascade, which is just rolling again and adding that to your total for an even higher total! You have some options on each turn in fighting this massive black fungusy mass of mutated humanoid, hopefully you are able to beat him and get the sick prise of a jetpack and katana to get yourself to the center of the Rotten City the quickest way possible... THE SKIES!</p>
