so far I have a majority of what i need set up
still need to grab some more pictures, properly set up some loops and functions, and fix an issue in my form as well as my game and I will be all set
issues is the form keeps submitting even though i have some anti submit options if none of the things are selected or written in
and for the game its not printing my cascade string, where if you roll a 6 it says something about you getting a cascade and it auto rolls another die ( that extra bit of function is also still being worked on)
all in all my three pages are almost complete, and what i think would be the 75% area
