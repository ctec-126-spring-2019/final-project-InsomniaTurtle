*Milestone #1*

I'm going to be producing a game that I have created for tabletop, but have decided it would be just as fun in digital form.
I'm not entirely sure whom I will make this with but will message different people in the class if they have a partner yet.
This game will have enemy npcs, a shop npc further in with a timer till he leaves that area and moves shop elsewhere.
A crafting system with atleast 20 different weapon/food/misc recipes ( may add more).
A combat system that uses a random dice roller which will be affected by the players 'stats', which can be rolled for prior.
The stats a player can roll for are HP, Soak, Smarts, chutzpa (if i misspelled its the charisma stat), Brawl, and Endurance.
Soak gets 1D6, the rest of the stats get 2D6 for their randomly generated stats (minimum 2, max 12).
I do want a random boss to be located further into the game ( nearest to the center of the city) named bill... make hims tough but give out huge reward.
guns and ammo are scarce but do high damage, melee weapons are more available but cant do more than 2D6.
Zombies max health can be 10 but min health can be 5 (an array would help this out), mutated zombies hop up to the 20's and 30's with a min of 15.
I want buttons to be able to be clicked and disabled till the next *ROUND*
Depending on the *CHECK* I want to use the dice roller or possibly the deck assignment to creature a proper combat system, if cards is the more fun to code then i will probably have to do a blackjack-esk combat system with altering values depending on card.
I want the heatlh total color css to change based on how much health is left on either player or npc, either friendly or agressive towards the pc.
I want to use an array randomizer for rarity of an items type of either *garbo*, *normal*, or *plus* dictating the durability and strength of an item (weapon). Which would be either a -2, 0, or +2 based on its type.
If the player or friendly npc gains a *MUTATION* then i would have a evt.preventDefault(); to *prevent* them from doing one of the two endings (escape the city or fight the boss). (unless ending 0... which is when the pc meets a terrible end)
I would like to use an array of atleast 4 or 5 areas.
main bits: a dice roller or blackjack esk combat system, npcs and pc, levels, mutations, weapons and items, health bar with changing css, *endings*, pre-rolled stats, timed shop npc, bosses (2:one is optional/random)
*update*: since it's just going to be me i'm going ot probaably have to simplify it to just a single area big boss kinda of deal, have a randomized item pool for players to use, dice roller stays, no npcs, no crafting, hp bar with color stays, mutations stays but change it a tad, only two endings which is either a loss or winscenario, possibly keep the optional boss depending on how well things go, prolly go with the black jack esk combat system using the card assignment.
